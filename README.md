# ECE 520L Final Project: Interfacing LCD with Raspberry Pi Pico

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the ECE 520L course at California State University, Northridge. The main objective was to interface an LCD to display custom characters and temperature readings using a Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Technical Details
The project utilized the I2C communication protocol and was developed using MicroPython. Custom characters were created using a web-based tool. Temperature readings were obtained using a thermistor.

### Development Environment Setup
The development environment was set up to support MicroPython and the necessary libraries for the I2C communication protocol.

### Creating Custom Characters
Custom characters were created using a web-based tool. These characters were then programmed into the LCD.

### Reading Temperature with a Thermistor
A thermistor was used to read the temperature. The readings were then displayed on the LCD.

### Coding for the LCD Display
Code was written in MicroPython to control the LCD display via the I2C communication protocol.

## Results
The project was successful in achieving its objectives. The LCD was able to display custom characters and temperature readings accurately.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with the Raspberry Pi Pico, I2C communication, and thermistor usage. It served as a practical application of the theoretical concepts learned in the ECE 520L course.
